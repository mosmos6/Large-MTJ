# Branch summary
This branch is the same as the **all** branch but with more informative logging when you're using this software to initialize a transformer network and load a checkpoint.

## Patches in this branch:
* __(/mesh_transformer/checkpoint.py and /mesh_transformer/transformer_shard.py)__ Added some extra logging.

Inherited from **soft**:
* __(/mesh_transformer/layers.py and /mesh_transformer/transformer_shard.py)__ Modified EmbeddingShard to support soft prompting ([arXiv:2104.08691](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08691.pdf)).

Inherited from **modelcompat**:

* __(/mesh_transformer/layers.py)__ Added support for more types of positional embedding:
    * `"pe": "sinusoidal"`: The original sinusoidal positional embedding described in the original paper on transformer models, "Attention Is All You Need" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf), in section 3.5 Positional Encoding.
    * `"pe": "fairseq_sinusoidal"`: A variant of sinusoidal positional embedding currently used by fairseq. Most fairseq causal language models use this type of positional embedding.
    * `"pe": "neox_rotary"`: A variant of rotary positional embedding used by GPT-NeoX. When using this, you can still specify `pe_rotary_dims` like with the `rotary` PE type.
    * `"pe": "alibi"`: Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12409.pdf. The implementation of ALiBi in this repository differs from the paper in that, in figure 3 of the paper, instead of using [0], [-1, 0], [-2, -1, 0], etc. as the coefficients of the bias matrix, we use [0], [0, 1], [0, 1, 2], etc. which allows for more efficient implementation. This implementation is compatible with the original one (models trained with either implementation produce identical results when run with either implementation).
* __(/mesh_transformer/layers.py and /mesh_transformer/transformer_shard.py)__ Changed the implementation of the loss function in ProjectionShard so that loss is only computed for tokens with token ID less than `n_vocab`.
* __(/convert_neo_pytorch_model_to_jax.ipynb)__ Created this notebook, which converts GPT-Neo models from pytorch_model.bin format to a format usable by this branch.
* __(/mesh_transformer/layers.py and /mesh_transformer/transformer_shard.py)__ Added some optional GPT-Neo/fairseq/GPT-NeoX/OPT compatibility config options to the v1 transformer:
    * `compat`: A string that can be set to `"j"`, `"neo"`, `"fairseq"`, `"neox"`, `"opt"` or `"bloom"`. Setting this to something other than `"j"` changes the architecture of the transformer network slightly to better conform to that of the corresponding model. Defaults to `"j"`.
    * `attention_layers`: A list with `layers` strings inside of it, each of which is either `"global"` or `"local"`, specifying whether each layer should use global or local attention. If `compat` is set to `"neo"`, this defaults to a list with alternating `"global"` and `"local"`, otherwise defaults to all `"global"`.
    * `local_attention_window`: A positive integer that specifies the window size for layers with local attention. Has no effect if all of your layers are global attention layers. Defaults to 256.
    * `n_vocab_padding`: A nonnegative integer, the amount of padding your input and output embeddings have. Defaults to 0.
    * `pe_shift`: A nonnegative integer -- what the first position ID should be when doing positional embedding. If `compat` is set to `"fairseq"`, this defaults to 2, otherwise 0.
    * `activation`: A string describing which activation function to use. Possible options are listed in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/activations.py. The default activation function depends on what `compat` is set to:
        * `"fairseq_lm"`: `"gelu"`
        * `"neox"` or `"bloom"`: `"gelu_fast"`
        * `"opt"`: `"relu"`
        * All other values: `"gelu_new"`
    * `combined_qkv`: A Boolean value. If set to `True`, uses GPT-NeoX-style strided QKV linear transformation with weight shape `(d_model, d_model * 3)` and bias shape `(d_model * 3,)` instead of three separate linear transformations each with weight shape `(d_model, d_model)` and bias shape `(d_model,)`. Defaults to `True` if compat is `"neox"` or `"bloom"`, otherwise `False`.
        * The first group of `d_model // n_heads` columns of the query weight and the first group of `d_model // n_heads` elements of the query bias correspond to the first group of `d_model // n_heads` columns of the strided QKV weight and the first group of `d_model // n_heads` elements of the strided QKV bias.
        * The first group of `d_model // n_heads` columns of the key weight and the first group of `d_model // n_heads` elements of the key bias correspond to the second group of `d_model // n_heads` columns of the strided QKV weight and the second group of `d_model // n_heads` elements of the strided QKV bias.
        * The first group of `d_model // n_heads` columns of the value weight and the first group of `d_model // n_heads` elements of the value bias correspond to the third group of `d_model // n_heads` columns of the strided QKV weight and the third group of `d_model // n_heads` elements of the strided QKV bias.
        * The second group of `d_model // n_heads` columns of the query weight and the second group of `d_model // n_heads` elements of the query bias correspond to the fourth group of `d_model // n_heads` columns of the strided QKV weight and the fourth group of `d_model // n_heads` elements of the strided QKV bias.
        * etc.
    * `neox_gpt_j_residual`: If `compat` is `"neox"`, this corresponds to the `gpt_j_residual` config option of GPT-NeoX models and defaults to `True`. If `compat` is set to anything else, this has no effect.
    * `pe_rotary_pct`: A floating point value. If set to a value greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1, we will ignore the value of `pe_rotary_dims` if it is set and instead use `math.floor(pe_rotary_pct * (d_model // n_heads))` as the value for `pe_rotary_dims`. Defaults to being unset.
    * `do_layer_norm_before`: A Boolean value. If `True`, causes the first layer norm to be done prior to self attention, and the second layer norm (if any) to be done before the MLP. Setting this to `False` causes the self attention to be done prior to the first layer norm and the MLP to be done prior to the second layer norm. Defaults to `True`. You should set this to `False` if you're using specifically the 350 million parameter OPT model, and leave this at `True` if you're using any OPT model with a different number of parameters or any non-OPT model.
* __(/mesh_transformer/layers.py)__ The implementation of standard positional embedding has been changed because the original implementation would've thrown an error. This does not affect GPT-J since it uses rotary positional embedding.

Inherited from **lowmem-fastinstall**:

* __(/mesh_transformer/util.py)__ ClipByGlobalNormState is now a subclass of optax.EmptyState instead of optax.OptState in order to maintain compatibility with optax 0.1.0 and higher.
* __(/requirements.txt)__ Removed requirements that aren't needed to use inference and relaxed most of the still-existing requirements. Also now requires progressbar2. Installation takes less time now.

Inherited from **lowmem**:

* __(/mesh_transformer/checkpoint.py)__ Copied the implementation of `read_ckpt` from https://github.com/VE-FORBRYDERNE/mtj-softtuner/commit/0b8a98f2a4cf84ff9dedd71808d7aa23e0551bc4

Inherited from **main**:

* __(/mesh_transformer/transformer_shard.py, /mesh_transformer/util.py)__ Optax is no longer required for model inference (you still need it to train models).
* __(/.gitattributes, /setup.cfg, /setup.py, /versioneer.py, /mesh_transformer/\_\_init.py\_\_, /mesh_transformer/\_version.py)__ python-versioneer is now used to automatically generate the version string.
* __(/requirements.txt)__ A new requirement for `chex >= 0.0.7, < 0.1.3` has been added.
* __(/mesh_transformer/checkpoint.py)__ If `smart_open` is not found, we will use Python's builtin `open` instead.
* __(/mesh_transformer/checkpoint.py)__ Ray is now imported when you call `read_sharded_v2()` (the only function in the file that uses Ray) so that you don't need to have Ray installed if you don't use the function.
* __(/mesh_transformer/transformer_shard.py)__ `CausalTransformer` now accepts `dematerialized` keyword argument, which defaults to `False` and can be set to `True` to attempt to predict the structure of the model parameter dictionary without using JAX.
* __(/mesh_transformer/layers.py)__ All einops calls have been replaced with equivalent JAX calls, removing the need for the Python package einops.
* __(/requirements.txt)__ No longer requires einops.
* __(/requirements.txt)__ Changed to specifically require JAX 0.2.12
* __(/mesh_transformer/sampling.py)__ `nucleaus_filter` now subtracts infinity from logits to be removed instead of 1e10.

# Mesh Transformer JAX

A haiku library using the `xmap`/`pjit` operators in JAX for model parallelism of transformers.

The parallelism scheme is similar to the [original Megatron-LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053), which is efficient
on TPUs due to the high speed 2d mesh network. There is also an experimental model version which implements [ZeRo style
sharding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054).

This library is designed for scalability up to approximately 40B parameters on TPUv3s, beyond which different
parallelism strategies should be used. See other implementations such as
[GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox) or [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) for that.

One future direction for research is integrating this codebase with
[swarm-jax](https://github.com/kingoflolz/swarm-jax), to achieve further scalability with pipeline parallelism.

`*` represents evaluation numbers reported by their respective authors, all other numbers are provided by
running the [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/) either with the released
weights or with API access. Due to subtle implementation differences as well as different zero shot task framing, these
might not be directly comparable. See [this blog post](https://www.eleuther.ai/research-log/gpt3-model-sizes/) for more
details.

`†` The Megatron-11B model provides no comparable metrics, and several implementations using the released weights do not
reproduce the generation quality and evaluations. (see [1](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/10301)
[2](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/2358) [3](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/2719))
Thus, evaluation was not attempted.

`‡` These models have been trained with data which contains possible test set contamination. The OpenAI GPT-3 models
failed to deduplicate training data for certain test sets, while the GPT-Neo models as well as this one is
trained on The Pile, which has not been deduplicated against any test sets.

# Architecture and Usage

Most scripts in this repository are designed to be run on TPUs, which under the
[TPU-VM architecture](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/system-architecture-tpu-vm) are virtual machines
which can run arbitrary code. Most scripts are designed to spin up a TPU, SSH into it to set up the dependencies
and copy code over from the local directory, and then start a [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray.git) worker
which can accept RPC calls.

The TPUVMs handles running model training steps and evaluation, checkpoint save and loading, while the driver python
program handles data loading and general orchestration (such as when to save checkpoints etc).

This means that most scripts (`train.py`, `eval_harness.py` etc) expect to be running on a GCE virtual machine in the
same region as the TPUs, to minimize RPC latency and data transfer cost. Other scripts
(usually ones which don't take a `--tpu` argument, such as `device_sample.py`, `device_serve.py` or `device_train.py`)
expect to be run directly on a TPUVM. The device_* scripts **only work on a v3-8** and not on larger pods.

Furthermore, there is an example (`resharding_example.py`) of how to convert the provided checkpoints (which have 8
shards in the case of GPT-J-6B) down to a smaller number, such as for when running on GPU(s).

### Fine-tuning

To fine-tune the model, run `device_train.py` on a TPU VM.  Using a TPU v3-8, you can fine-tune at a rate of ~5000
tokens/second, which should be sufficient for small-to-medium-size datasets.

Please read the [step by step guide](howto_finetune.md) for thorough fine-tuning instructions.

### JAX Dependency

Note this library has some specific requirements for JAX version. Specifically, to use the v1 models (including
 GPT-J 6B), `jax==0.2.12` is required. This in turn depends on `jaxlib==0.1.68`. **If this is not done, you will get
cryptic xmap errors**

However, to use the v2 model code (no publicly released weights), the newest JAX version can be used.
